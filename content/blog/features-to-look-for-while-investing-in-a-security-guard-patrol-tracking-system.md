 ## GPS Live Tracking** 
 
 The system should include the GPS live tracking feature. It should be accurate and should provide you live information about all the working security guards. Most of the guard patrol tracking systems can be installed in smartphones making it very convenient to keep on track over the activity of the working security guards with your mobile device.
