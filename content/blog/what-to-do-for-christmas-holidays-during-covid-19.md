* ## Book your video-call with Santa:

Different applications allow you to book a call with Santa Claus and let your kids get the great feeling of Christmas.


*  ## Decorate with festive spirit:

Even if you cannot go out and enjoy the Christmas walks and shopping, this does not mean you should cut short on your Christmas decoration. Go ahead and decorate your house. You can explore many creative ideas available on the net or try out something on your own. Use store-bought items or do some DIYs to decorate the house most festively.


*  ### Engage in a holiday puzzle:

Holiday puzzles are huge and they can easily engage the entire family for several days. You can buy a holiday puzzle and start making it with all the members of your family. You will get enough time to bond together and the final results of the puzzle will be equally amazing.


* ### Make plans:

When you have ample time in your hands, you can think about your future. Make plans for your business. For instance, security guard companies can plan for automation and invest in workforce management software. Likewise, you can work on your financial plans and consider expanding your business goals or personal goals.

Just like the virtual Santa visit, you can also host a virtual Christmas party and enjoy the season. You will be surprised to know how much you can enjoy a virtual get together. Several apps allow you to create virtual meeting rooms and enjoy your time with your family and friends.
