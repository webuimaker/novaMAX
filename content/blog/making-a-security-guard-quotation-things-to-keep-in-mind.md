For security companies, the competition has toughened in the past few years. The increased crime rates have made businesses and individuals conscious of their security and safety. Thus, they go for the best security company near them.

Having said that, if a client has approached you inquiring about your security services, chances are high that they are talking to several other companies simultaneously. 

So, your goal here is to stand out and be professional. The first thing that will make or break the deal for you is your **security guard quotation**. Before sending this formal document to your prospective client, you must know that it can do wonders for your business! It can either push you to the list of selected companies or to that of rejected ones. This small piece of information about your business holds a lot of power. Let us see how you can make it right and turn things in your favor.

Keep in mind a lot goes into sending the security quotation the right way. Here we will tell you about all these factors one by one:

**1) Timing**

As discussed above, when a prospect looks for security services, they talk to more than one company. Thus, you don’t want to lose the game to another security company just because it was prompt.  

Never lose time and send your quotation right away after the first communication you have with your prospect. Do not give your prospective clients time to rethink or re-consider you. If you have managed to leave a good impression through your first conversation, an impressive **security guard quotation** will reinforce it. While it is handy to keep it ready beforehand, you should also be flexible with what’s written in there. Every prospect has a different requirement, and the description within the security quotation should be changeable as required. Talking about creating the security quotation, let us see how you can do that.  

**2) Template**

Choosing an adequate template and **security guard quotation** format is also crucial. The first thing to note is that it should look professional. So, be careful with the language, the elements, and the tone used in the quotation. Here are the things you must include:

*   The logo and name of your security company

*   The address of your company

*   **Security guard quotation** number

*   Date of writing and issuing the quotation

*   The name of your prospect

*   The address of your prospect

*   Service description 

*   Terms and Conditions of services

While most things in the quotation are mere details, you can work up the magic in the service description. It is the perfect spot for you to explain what you have to offer to the prospect and how you stand out from the competitors. You can explain what protocols you use to recruit and train the security guards, how they work, and how you supervise their work. You can also mention the [security guard management system](/workforce-management-for-security-company/) that you are using within the company. 

With a good description, perfect portfolio, and professional presentation, your **security guard quotation** can help you convert leads. 

**3) Follow Up**

Just like the time to send the quotation, the time to follow up also matters. Don’t be too hasty about it and give your prospects time to go through the quotation and revert accordingly. Three business days is an acceptable time to wait for the response. After that, you can send an email to follow up.

Also, if your client has mentioned a date on which they will revert, be patient and wait for the same. If the date has passed without any response from them, you can send a follow-up email. 

**4) Approach**

Your approach while sending the **security guard quotation** to your clients matters the most. Make sure you maintain professionalism throughout the process. From your first conversation with the client to the conversation after the quotation is approved – everything needs to be done carefully. One slip-up can cost you a good project. 

So, make sure you follow a professional approach. Don’t sound too hasty or pushy, don’t oversell yourself, and don’t brag about your experience or previous clients. 

The other thing to keep in mind is to accept only written approvals. If a client says they have approved your quotation, ask them to share the written word for it. Such an approach is beneficial for all.
