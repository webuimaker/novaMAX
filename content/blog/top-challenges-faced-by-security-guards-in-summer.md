Carrying out a smooth workflow of a **security guard company** and delivering top-notch security services take diligent effort. While the management works hard to keep the workflow managed, the security guards still have the toughest task at hand. Besides the extreme weather conditions, the dangers at the job, and other hardships, they are required to offer nothing but high security.  

However, no matter how well-trained and experienced your security guards are. They still face troubles in certain conditions. The most common instance is when they have to be on duty under the scorching heat of the summer sun.  

As a **security guard company,** you must be aware of the **common problems of security guards in summer.** It will help you take the right actions to safeguard them from the struggles and hardships.  So, let’s discuss these problems and find the possible solutions for them:    

## 1\. Exposure to the Scorching Sun

With most of us doing office jobs, most of us are unfamiliar with the hardships that people with field jobs face. For a security guard deployed outside a building, it gets very tough during summer to stand under and get direct exposure to the scorching heat of the sun.  

For patrolling or static guards, this situation might lead to heatstroke, nosebleeds, and other health challenges.  

To tackle the problem, a security company should provide their guards with the right resources like a suitable uniform or a sheltered area to deploy them.     

### 2\. Rashes and Skin Troubles

Hot weather means excessive sweating, especially when you are outdoors. For security guards, being out in the open under the sun is a usual scenario. While the sun’s heat has other side effects too, it leads to excessive sweating. On top of that, the guards have to wear uniforms too. So, dealing with sweat and related problems becomes one of the biggest **challenges of security guards in summer.** 

They experience skin rashes, sunburn, freckles, and other skin problems due to exposure to the sun and excessive sweating.    

### 3\. Impact on Performance and Mood

Security guards are human beings too. So, it is inevitable that extreme weather conditions will impact their mood. Excessive heat during the summer season leads to an irritated mood. It impacts the performance of the security guards as they may lash out in the public or react in an aggravating way.

This might lead to aggravated outbursts, scuffles, and nuisances that the security guards have to deal with. It adds to their challenges at the job.    

### 6\. Heat-related Hazards

Excessive heat might lead to accidents like the electric facilities of a building catching fire. These scenarios are quite common in summer and may lead to hazards like fire. The security guards have to work with such dangers lurking around. Also, they need to be prepared for such hazards with the right equipment and backup to avoid losses.
