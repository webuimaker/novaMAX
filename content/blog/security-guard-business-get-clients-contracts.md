## 1. Stand out of the Crowd!   

{{< figure src="/images/novagems-img/blogs/guard-company.jpg" >}}

The first thing you need to do is make yourself exclusive. If you follow the common practices like all your competitors, you create more confusion for the clients. But how to be the unique security guard business in demand? You must offer the unusual to the client. While uncompromised security remains the main target, it is also important that you help the client achieve peace of mind. You must offer them services that are easy to integrate with their business practices. From communicating security patrol schedules to [reporting incidents](https://novage.ms/physical-security-incident-management-system/) and more on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, you must try to keep the client in a loop when performing security. You must focus on offering client-satisfaction and it is what makes you a one-of-a-kind business.

A fine way to ensure transparency in the security guard business and ensure client-satisfaction is by using advanced technology. Security management software is a must-have tool that allows you to keep the client informed and offer top-notch customer service.

**2. Make a powerful Pricing Strategy**

This demands a lot of research. You must know what your competitors charge and try to make yourself more approachable. A lot of factors go into deciding the price of your services. From costs such as training the guard, cost of Security Guard Management Software, cost of operations, salary of the guards, and other marketing and financial budgets are important, you must also check that your price remains synced with the existing price in the industry. Do not offer a very cheap price quote, neither set your standards extremely high. Work on the pricing strategy and strike out a price that justifies the costs while offering the client satisfaction of paying for the actual worth.

 **3. Work on Contract Proposals; they must be enticing!**

Bidding on a new contract demands a lot of research. It is your contract proposal that makes the whole difference and creates the first impression. Do not make a generic contract proposal for all your clients. Instead, focus on customization. If you are working on a brand new property, you must include relative terms in the contract and mention the most common incidents at that type of property and what you will do to prevent them. Similarly, for businesses that are working with other security guard businesses, make sure you tell them why hiring you would be an advantage. Work on your contract proposals extensively and make them more attractive and compelling.

 **4. Research before you act!**

Do not bid for just any contract or approach a client without research. You must remember how rigorously you researched before you started the security business. Just like that, you need to put all your resources into evaluating the available opportunities and apply for the ones that appear winnable.

A great practice to woo the client is to request a property walk before you bid for the contract. This will make the potential client believe that you are serious about the work and not just another company wanting more business.

During the property walk, you get a perfect opportunity to show your expertise to the client. The exercise allows you to win the trust of the client and at the same time, offer an opportunity to the client to evaluate your credibility.

 **5. Market yourself with Digital means!**

If you stick with the conventional marketing approach, you need to do better. Digitalization has hit us hard and for good. While as a smart security guard business you may be already using Security Guard Management Software, ty need to maximize the use of technology and choose to market your business through digital channels. Build an impressive website, work on your SEO ranking, use PPC and Guest blogging for better connectivity and utilize social media for business promotions. Remember, the more your clients see you on different platforms, the better they perceive you as a potential security business for collaborations. When you use the modern means of marketing, you can create an image of an aware business with hands-on knowledge of technology and trends.

**6. Work on your reviews and ratings**

As per Google, over 91% of millennials trust online reviews. Moreover, over half of the consumers do not trust security guard vendor companies that have a rating of lower than 4 stars. Adding to it, positive reviews can lift the conversion rate by more than 10%. Working on your reviews and ratings can help you amazingly in lifting the business image and making yourself a credible business.

You must ask your existing client to leave testimonials on your business website. You must also do efforts to get positive Google reviews as Google reviews to make over 57.5% of the total reviews around the globe.

**7. Review and Upgrade**

Marketing strategies can be made flawless but they are a constant. You must review your marketing strategy from time to time and upgrade. New trends and interests develop in your client market and it is important to ensure that your security guard business is synced with them when approaching a prospective customer. Improvise your branding, work on your training methods and brush your online presence now and then to stay alert and make a business that follows the latest trends.
