If we look into the setup of a security guard company years from now, we will see how they managed everything manually. There used to be no record whatsoever of a guard’s presence at the place of duty. So, security guards could easily deceive and waver accountability.

However, thankfully, tech has changed the scene for security companies. With the right guard tour system, it is easy to keep track of the movement of your security guards. The tools and features like [GPS and Geofencing](https://flamboyant-benz-eb887f.netlify.app/blog/5-common-problems-a-guard-tour-system-can-help-resolve-novagems-test/#) allow managers to set authorized areas for all guards. In such a case, whenever the guard leaves or enters the geofenced area, the managers get notifications in real-time. So, it is easy to hold the guards accountable for the tasks and duties assigned to them as you can keep a close eye on them.
