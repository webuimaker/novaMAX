{{< figure src="/images/novagems-img/blogs/Internet-of-Things-2.jpg" >}}

To improve aviation security and the associated passenger experience, IoT devices have significant potential. In addition to generating data for queue monitoring and analytics, sensors can be used to control environmental variables, including lighting, temperature and ambient noise.

It even helps to monitor and control the environment in such a way that is customizable for any given screening checkpoint.

3. **Screening Technologies**

{{< figure src="/images/novagems-img/blogs/Screening-Technologies-2.jpg" >}}

When it comes to advanced passenger screening, technologies will find new ways to detect threats. With the right screening technologies like X-ray diffraction, it will give detailed information about the substances being scanned.

Many small and microwave-detecting cameras offer a chance to build extremely fast scanners that operate at very high refresh rates. This would ultimately help to take images without any images while passengers walkthrough.

4. **Biometrics**

Biometric technology helps to identify his or her intrinsic physical or behavioral traits, which are already being used in airports. And to detect fake passports, U.S. Customs and Border Protection is efficiently using facial recognition software. With biometric technology, it can bring greater efficiencies like Transportation Security Administration’s PreCheck to make the screening journey hassle-free.

And simultaneously, it is important for the Aviation Security Services provider to ensure regular evaluation of the security operations. Make sure they have a robust reporting structure and multiple data collection methods.

5. **Queue Monitoring/Behavioral Analytics**
