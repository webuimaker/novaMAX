It is now common knowledge of how a simple office matter can become the core reason for a heinous crime outside the workplace. There is ample shocking news heard and criticized by us that shows that workplace violence is a serious and real issue. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states that it is the core responsibility of the employer to ensure that the employees are safe in all aspects including workplace violence. To prevent workplace violence, it is very important to understand it first and then create a customized approach.  **You will learn:**

1.  [**Who is at risk for Workplace Violence?**](#first)
2.  [**Assess the climate to know the reality**](#second)
3.  [**Communicate and convey**](#third)
4.  [**Have a strategy to deal with a situation**](#fourth)

 From engaging highly trained security guards to implementing a guard tour system for active monitoring and training your employees for workplace violence prevention, these are the core steps taken to actively handle and prevent any workplace violence case.

1\. **Who is at risk for workplace violence?**

Commonly, four types of workplace violence is reported, including:

*   Criminal intent (e.g., a robbery by a third person)
*   Customer/client violence
*   Worker-on-worker
*   Personal relationship (such as domestic violence)/li>

Certain risk factors further increase the chances of violence against a particular group of people including women as they are vulnerable in certain cases, occupation, and physical appearance. 

2\. **Assess the climate to know the reality**

As an active leader, you must know what is going on in your organization. If you do not have the current update, you are lacking as a leader. The more you know, the better you will be able to prevent any untoward incident. You must take out time to evaluate if there have been any incidents that make someone vulnerable. People react to situations in a unique way and hence having an eye over unusual behavior is really important. If you notice any surge in the cases of outbursts, belligerence, threats, or changes in appearance or attitude you must observe them closely. You can rely on workforce management software to check any performance loss in the employees. 

3\. **Communicate and Convey**

Lack of communication is one of the core reasons why people have outbursts. Moreover, frustration in the job further affects the way we handle the situations and react to them. It is advisable that businesses set up a work culture where they practice open dialogue. If not, at least there will be a proper channel to put your thoughts in front of colleagues or seniors. If you do not allow the employees to vent out, frustration builds more intense and the results are devastating. 

4\. **Have a Strategy to deal with the Situation**

When different people work together, they may have disagreements. You cannot avoid disagreements, however, you can always ensure that the level of disagreement is below the red line. Having a plan to deal with a spur of violence is a must. You can also train your employees for violence management at the workplace or direct your security guards that they be more observant to any change of behavior.
