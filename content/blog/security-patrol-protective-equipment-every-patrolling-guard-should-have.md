All security companies strive towards one common aim - delivering the best security to their clients. However, it is easier said than done. For security companies to operate smoothly, they need to dodge many bullets. [Security guards and patrolling officers](/workforce-management-for-security-company) are always at risk as their job involves danger. 

For this reason, security companies are always on the lookout for the best security guard equipment checklist they can follow. If you are also looking for that checklist for your security company, you have landed on the right page. 

Here are the top three security guard tools and equipment that your patrolling officers must have with them all the time:


## 1) Armored Gear 

When security guards are on duty, they do everything in their power to provide safety to their clients and everyone around them. So, even if the entire building is under attack, a security guard will tackle the criminals rather than run away for safety. 

It is why a security guard needs to have self-defense weapons. However, it is also why security guards or patrolling officers are more prone to attacks. If the guard fires a gunshot, they should expect the backfire. And for this, **security guards and patrolling officers** should always be prepared.

The guards should always have armored gear like bulletproof vests, body armor, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). This gear saves them from stabbing attacks, gunshots, shrapnel bullets, etc. So, armored gear is one of the most used [security guard accessories](/workforce-management-for-security-company) for patrol officers.  

## 2) Heavy-duty Footwear and Tactical Belt

Security guards need to be active and alert all the time. Their duty demands them to move from site to site, be prepared for a chase, and practically be on their feet all the time. 

So, one of the most crucial personal security equipment pieces for security guards is boots! Provide your guards with tactical boots that help them stay both comfortable and prepared. The tactical boots of security guards should be suitable for multiple terrains and offer flexibility.

On the same note, security guards should also have a tactical belt that they can use to keep their equipment handy. The self-defense weapons should be reachable for a security guard. So, they can easily access them when required. A tactical belt keeps everything intact and in the right place for patrol officers. 

## 3) Mobile Devices 

In our security guard equipment checklist, mobile devices are one of the most important things. While we see technology wherever we go, having a tech-fueled mobile device helps security guards in many ways. 

With the right [guard monitoring system](/workforce-management-for-security-company), you can easily access the guard’s location through [GPS tracking](/gps-geofence). So, if the control center needs to locate the guard or a patrolling vehicle, they can access the guard through their mobile device. A guard monitoring system also helps the guard press a button and ask for help from the control center. It is helpful in emergencies when guards need backup. Besides all these security features, such a system in your security guard’s mobile device will help you share schedules and communicate with the guard whenever required.
