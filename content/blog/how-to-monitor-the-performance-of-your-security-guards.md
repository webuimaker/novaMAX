Delivering unerring security services is like a constant uphill battle. You cannot be lenient one day and strict the other – you always need to keep things top-notch to avoid danger and keep your clients safe. [security guard tracking](https://novage.ms/security-guard-management-assistance/) becomes crucial.

Many security business owners do not know how to keep track of their security guards and measure their performance. If you have been looking for a solution too, a security guard management system is your answer. With such a system in place, you can keep track of the whereabouts and performance of your security guards.

## Let us see how you can monitor the performance of your security guards with a security guard management system:

### 1). Plan and Execute a Schedule

For security companies, it gets tough to manage the schedules of their guards without an adequate system. So, we advise you to execute a security guard management system for your security company.

Such a system provides for mobile and web applications that have different user dashboards based on their roles. For instance, the management or supervisors will work on one dashboard, and the security guards will work on another one. It is like the front-end and back-end of an app.

However, such a system allows you to plan and execute a schedule for all the guards in one go. They can access and follow it from their mobile devices, making it easy for the management to keep track of everything. Once you cover everything with the help of such a system and manage it online, it becomes easier to see whether the guards are following the schedule or not. The system records if there are any slip-ups, which you can confront later.

### 2). Keep Track of Their Shifts

An extension of the previous point, this one suggests that the management must keep an eye on the shift timings of the guards. If a guard has to report to the site at 9 AM, leaving at 2 PM, you must regularly note their presence and absence.

You can also do it with the help of a guard tracking system. If the guards neglect the shift timings and are irregular, the supervisors can act accordingly. With features like geofencing and other tracking features, the system notifies the supervisors when a guard enters or leaves the point of duty. So, whether they are arriving late or leaving early, the managers can take suitable action.  

### 3). Report Their Performance

When you keep regular track of everything, it gets easier for the management to report the performance of each security guard.

The adherence to the schedule, punctuality, management of work, behavior on duty, problem-solving aptitude, actions taken during emergencies, etc. should be recorded. Once you collect such data by personal observance and with the help of a security guard management system, you can measure the performance of the guards. Such information will tell you who is performing to their full potential and who isn’t. So, the management can act as per the company policies.

If you choose the guard management system by Novagems, you can also keep tabs of the guards’ performance through color-codes and symbols. They help you visualize things clearly and keep track of continual progress. For example,Green for the on time performed tasks,  yellow can be for Late performed tasks , red for absence or not done tasks, etc.

### 4). Use GPS Tracking

The duty of security guards involves risk and danger to their life. However, their responsibility is to safeguard the lives of others by ensuring complete safety. Thus, the absence of deployed guards from the point of duty can become a matter of life or death.

To make sure this does not happen, a security company should seek help from a well-functioning GPS tracking system. It will help you locate your guards and see whether they have reported to their duties or not. The features like geofencing will also alert the management whenever a guard enters or leaves a restricted area.

With GPS tracking, it is easier to monitor your guards along with providing the required help during emergencies. A GPS security guard tracking system is also very beneficial for security guards on patrol duty.

### 5). Pay Field Visits

It is easier to trust your old and experienced security guards. However, for the new recruits, you need to be extra careful. As a security company cannot take a chance with the duties delivered by security guards, you can follow a strict supervision pattern for the new guards.

Even if you already have a security guard tracking system in place, paying field visits is a good idea. When the supervisors monitor the performance of security guards by paying surprise visits, they will be more cautious and serious about their duties. It is good for the reputation of your company as well as the performance of security guards.
