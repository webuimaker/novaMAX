# Guard Tracking System

Real-time situational awareness of your security guard team is an added advantage that allows security guard companies to offer enhanced security to their customers. The better your security supervisor knows about the latest position and activities of the security guard, the more efficiently they can evaluate the level of security provided to the client. The modern guard tour system is fitted with GPS (Global Positioning System) capabilities which make tracking and monitoring guard movements very easy and accurate. At Novagems, we develop feature-rich security guard apps for you that work on GPS based tracking features, offering you the accurate location of your security force at any given point of time.

The security guard tracking software enabled with GPS tracking not only allows security companies to know the whereabouts of their security guards but also in authenticating various reports. The database created and maintained by the security guard tour software can be accessed by the supervisors to cross-check and verify checkpoint scans, activity reports, incident reports, visitor logs, etc. The supervisors can even get a photographic record of the guards’ movement and attach them with their reports if required.

Uncompromised security with better control:

When you know your security guards have missed a checkpoint or deviated from the due security track, you can point it out and interrogate the reason for the deviation. The guard on duty also feels obligated to perform the duty in the due manner as they are being observed 24/7. The supervisors can rely on the periodic movement reports generated by the software or generate their own reports as and when required. The guard tour system will however generate an alert if there is any deviation in duties.
