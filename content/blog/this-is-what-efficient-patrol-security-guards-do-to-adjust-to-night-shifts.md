Night shifts in the security industry are tougher than you think. Not only does a night shift affect the biological clock of the security guard, but it also puts the safety of the client at risk. Besides, the change of the sleep patterns and continuous efforts towards making is \[possible can be very challenging for the security guard- both mentally and physically. It IS effective security guard management and some tried and tested ways that a security guard can effectively prepare for the night shifts. 

## Some Quick Tips:

1.  [**Prepare for the transition**](#first)
2.  [**Stay hydrated**](#second)
3.  [**Cut down on caffeine**](#third)
4.  [**Sleep like a baby**](#fourth)
5.  [**Eat healthy and stay fit**](#fifth)

 It is important to be cautious about the big transition and know what to do to make it right. Let us know how to do that:

1\. **Prepare for the transition**

Thankfully, security guards do not have to work with forced shift schedules. The modern [guard patrol monitoring system](https://novage.ms/guard-patrol-monitoring-systems/) allows the supervisors to create shifts and open them for the security guards. The patrol guard can then acknowledge the shifts and accept the shifts. If the security guard is not comfortable with the assigned shift, they can let the supervisor know. The system allows enough time to the security guards to prepare for their new schedule, both mentally and physically. 

2\. **Stay hydrated**

A healthy body can give a patrol guard enough energy to perform the vigorous night shifts. In fact, staying hydrated for the day shift is also equally important. A well-hydrated body allows the security guard to stay awake, fresh, and alert at all times, especially during the wee hours of the night and morning. 

3\. **Cut down on caffeine**

While it is a common notion that additional caffeine can help you stay awake and alert, the excess caffeine actually works adversely with your sleep cycles. Moreover, when you use caffeine very regularly, you might as well get addicted to it. A better way to ensure you do not fall asleep is keeping a track of your clock and reporting to the supervisor in due intervals. 

4\. **Sleep like a baby**

When you are off duty, which is during the day in this particular case, make sure you sleep like a baby. Initially, the change in your biological clock will affect your body and you will feel restless and anxious. However, as you continue the new pattern, the adjustment will be easier. Make sure you have a good 7-8 hours of sleep. It might be difficult to sleep in the daytime but you must make some arrangements to ensure your sleep is uninterrupted. 

5\. **Eat healthy and stay fit**

Besides drinking plenty of water, make sure you also eat a good and healthy diet that fulfills your energy level for the tough night shifts. Eat a lot of grains and vegetables and ensure that you get a balanced dose of vitamins and minerals through your diet. Avoid eating anything over spicy or greasy before the night shift as it can make you feel drowsy. In fact, prefer salads or fruits before you go for the night shift. When you combine the security patrol management system and these tips together, you get your way to handle the tough night shifts.
